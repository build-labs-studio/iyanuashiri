      <description>Before starting any Python project, it is highly recommended and best practice to create a virtual environment. The tool we use for creating virtual environments is called virtualenv. Virtualenv isolates your Python set-up on a per-project basis. This means that changes made to one Python project won’t affect another Python project.
Setting up virtualenv On a Windows, Linux or OS X mkdir example_project cd example_project  The next step is to make our virtual environment.</description>

      <description>Type Hints: Adding Types to Legacy Codebases Introduction Python is an interpreted and dynamic language. This means Python code is executed at runtime and also doesn&amp;rsquo;t make use of a type system when defining language constructs such as variables and functions.
In Python 3.5, the typing module was introduced. This allows Python code to be gradually typed i.e Types can be added to some parts (variables, functions, classes etc.) of a codebase and checked at runtime (static typing) and some other parts (variables, functions etc.</description>

      <description>The first time you get introduced to Python&amp;rsquo;s variable, it is usually defined as &amp;ldquo;parts of your computer’s memory where you store some information.&amp;rdquo; Some define it as a &amp;ldquo;storage placeholder for texts and numbers.&amp;rdquo; We will soon find out that Python&amp;rsquo;s variable is deeper than this.
Python&amp;rsquo;s variable is a reference to an object created in the computer&amp;rsquo;s memory. The object can be a String, Integer etc. In Python, everything is an object.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will guide you on how to use the Pathlib module for working with filesystem paths, the benefits, and understand the problem it solves since the Python standard library already contains os.path.
How is it Better than os.path os.path was the only way to work with filesystem paths, but it had some limitations. To perform certain tasks, you have to import from other standard library modules. For instance, suppose you want to list the files ending with .</description>
