      <description>Hi I&amp;rsquo;m Iyanuoluwa. My nickname is Ashiri (meaning secret). I&amp;rsquo;m a Lead Software Engineer at Teapot and a Technical Writer at Twilio. My favourite tool is Python, but if need be, I can use JavaScript. I am currently learning to use Golang.
I love to meet new and interesting people, read good books, and write about what I have read. I contribute to opensource, speak about new, hard, interesting stuff in the Python community, and mentor new developers.</description>
