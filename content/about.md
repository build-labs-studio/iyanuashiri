Hi I'm Iyanuoluwa. My nickname is Ashiri (meaning secret). I'm a Lead Software Engineer at
Teapot and a Technical Writer at Twilio. My favourite tool is Python, but if need be, I can use
JavaScript. I am currently learning to use Golang.

I love to meet new and interesting people, read good books, and write about what I have read. 
I contribute to opensource, speak about new, hard, interesting stuff in the Python community, 
and mentor new developers.

Oh, the above is what I do. I want to make a conscious effort to describe myself by who I am and not what 
I do. So head over to my Twitter page [@IyanuAshiri](https://www.twitter.com/iyanuashiri) to know who I am.
